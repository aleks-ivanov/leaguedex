          Perhaps people frequently ask you about how to play a certain champion
          and you have been planning to write an in depth guide on how to play
          but never really took the time to do so, since it costs a lot of free
          time.. Well donâ€™t worry!
          <BreakLine />
          Leaguedex has this covered for you. You can share your dex with others
