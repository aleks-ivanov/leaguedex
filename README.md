# About

League is created for players who want to improve or share their knowledge of certain matchups. You create an account,
link your summoner account (You dont login with your league account) and get into a game! When in a game Leaguedex will detect it,
and give you the option to pick the matchup you are playing and then provide you with helpful tools :)

## Developer Notes

### Setup

If you dont have `concurrently` installed globally then please do so:

```
> yarn global add concurrently
```

There are 2 required .env files within the server folder, look for the example.env files and save those as `.env`.
When that's done cd into `server` and run bootstrap.sh! The `development` branch has it's own staging env and everything
will be merged here before it goes to prod.
